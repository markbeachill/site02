## 1. Introduction

Getting an AI to write something for you is cheating and will stop you learning. If you get AI to do your work for you then you will never improve, master the subject or improve your writing. It’s also very possible an assessor will spot AI written work as plagiarism immediately – it has its own patterns of vocabulary, grammar and structure that are unlike student work.

If you get an AI to act in a similar way to a human personal tutor then this can actually enhance your learning. You can do this by asking the right questions and using the results consciously and carefully. A good human tutor will guide you and help you but not do the work for you – can we get the AI to do the same?

This is a guide to help you try to use AI as a personal tutor that can help you check your work going forward. You can use it to get clearer and better writing.

The bulk of the information here is a set of prompts to get the AI acting as a personal tutor by giving you support on the paragraphs that you write.

Remember, if you don’t get what you want or it stops halfway then tell the AI chatbot and it will try again.  
  
**A BIG WARNING:** The AI gets things wrong all the time. These are often quite subtle errors of meaning. Do not take what it writes as simply correct. Always apply your own judgement and scepticism. Indeed, if there is ANY reason to question its response then absolutely QUESTION ITS RESPONSE. This is even more important because when you question its response it will tend to give a better answer and it will explain more.

## 2. Some principles to apply

1) never ask it to write something for you (like you would never ask your university tutor).

2) always start with your own writing.

3) always expect it can make things up like quotes!

4) read your original and the new version as if you have personal tutor.

6) And then type in your new version using the insights from the feedback.

7) Only ever use things you understand – look things up when you don’t (or ask the AI to explain!)

8) Remember you are 100% responsible for what you submit.

9) If you are unsure contact your tutor.

10) Save a record of what you did and the results for further study.

## 3. AI websites

Don’t just stick to one AI engine – you should try several and evaluate how each works for you.

They will also change over time so periodically retry new ones for the best results. And the free versions may be different from the paid versions.

This should generally not cost you money. If you run out of free prompts on one site then you may have to wait – or simply try another chatbot.

All these are worth trying with Claude, ChatGPT and Grok doing quite well.
