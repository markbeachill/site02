### What it does

The prompt goes through a piece of writing and provides feedback on the effectiveness of your paragraph structure and organsaition.

It looks at: structure, organisation, topic sentence, flow, clarity and whether this works for a reader. 

It provides suggestions but only by changing as few words as possible and has been instructed not to alter meaning or vocabulary. 


### Instructions

Copy the prompt below and paste this into a chatbot such as ChatGPT, Claude or Grok etc. Submit the prompt.

The chatbot will ask you to submit your writing. Paste in the writing you want to analyse and submit it.

### Sample output


### **Paragraph 1**

**Original:**
> Britain’s identity has been ever-changing, it has evolved through centuries of exchange, adaptation and migration. The post World War 2 Windrush generation from the Caribbean, who brought vital labour to rebuild the nation, the influence of South Asian communities on cuisine and music and the integration of other European migrants, all demonstrate how British culture absorbs and transforms.

**Feedback:**
- The paragraph opens well, but the first sentence is a comma splice (two independent clauses joined incorrectly by a comma). This affects clarity.
- The topic sentence could be more sharply defined: what *exactly* are you arguing about British identity?
- The second sentence is long and could be broken for clarity.
- Consider foregrounding the argument rather than examples in the second sentence.

**Improved:**
> **Britain’s identity has never been fixed.** It has evolved through centuries of exchange, adaptation and migration. The post-World War 2 Windrush generation from the Caribbean, who brought vital labour to rebuild the nation; the influence of South Asian communities on cuisine and music; and the integration of other European migrants all demonstrate how British culture absorbs and transforms.

**Changes Highlighted:**
- Changed “has been ever-changing” to **“has never been fixed”** – clearer and more direct.
- Replaced comma with a full stop after "migration" to fix the comma splice.
- Separated listed groups with semicolons for readability.
- Removed commas around “all demonstrate…” to clarify the sentence structure.

### **Paragraph 2**

**Original:**
> Even quintessential British things like fish and chips were brought over by Jewish immigrants or even the language we speak today is a hybrid of Germanic, Latin and French roots, these all reflect the fluidity of the British nation.

**Feedback:**
- Again, a comma splice: this is one long sentence that needs breaking up.
- Two different ideas are squeezed into one sentence – the food and the language. Consider separating for flow and emphasis.
- The topic sentence should make clearer how these examples support your argument.

**Improved:**
> Even quintessentially British things like fish and chips were brought over by Jewish immigrants. **Even the language we speak today is a hybrid of Germanic, Latin and French roots.** These all reflect the fluidity of the British nation.

**Changes Highlighted:**
- Replaced “Even quintessential British things” with **“Even quintessentially British things”** (more idiomatic).
- Broke up the long sentence into two for clarity.
- Started the second idea with **“Even the language we speak…”** to add emphasis and rhythm.

### Overall Notes

You have a clear voice and strong control of tone. Your content is compelling, but your paragraph structure sometimes gets in the way of clarity. To improve:

- Avoid comma splices. If in doubt, split sentences or use semicolons/dashes.
- Start each paragraph with a clear point — the topic sentence should guide everything that follows.
- Watch for overlong sentences and break them for clarity.

Would you like to revise any of these paragraphs based on this feedback and get a second round of review?
