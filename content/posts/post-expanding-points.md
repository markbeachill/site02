### What it does

The prompt goes through a piece of writing and provides ideas for where each paragraph might be expanded.

The ideas are to help improve the effectioveness of the points your writing is making.

They are not to add detail for its own sake or simply aimed at increasing the wordcount. 

### Instructions

Copy the prompt below and paste this into a chatbot such as ChatGPT, Claude or Grok etc. Submit the prompt.

The chatbot will ask you to submit your writing. Paste in the writing you want to analyse and submit it.

### Sample output


### **Paragraph 1:**

> *Britain's identity has been ever-changing, it has evolved through centuries of exchange, adaptation and migration. The post World War 2 Windrush generation from the Caribbean, who brought vital labour to rebuild the nation, the influence of South Asian communities on cuisine and music and the integration of other European migrants, all demonstrate how British culture absorbs and transforms.*

**Suggestions for expansion:**
- You could briefly name **specific ways** each group shaped Britain — for example, jobs the Windrush generation took on, or cultural traditions introduced by South Asian or European communities.
- Consider **breaking this long sentence into two or three** for clarity. This gives more space to build each point.
- You might also mention **why this history matters today** — for instance, how it challenges narrow views of what it means to be British.
- Think about making the **timeline clearer**. For example, “Over centuries, including key periods like post-WW2, Britain has…” This helps the reader follow the evolution.

### **Paragraph 2:**

> *Even quintessential British things like fish and chips were brought over by Jewish immigrants or even the language we speak today is a hybrid of Germanic, Latin and French roots, these all reflect the fluidity of the British nation.*

**Suggestions for expansion:**
- You could **split this sentence**. For example, one about fish and chips, one about language. That way, each point has room to be made clearly.
- Briefly **mention which Jewish community** introduced fish and chips (e.g. Sephardic Jews), to strengthen your historical point.
- For the language example, you could offer **one or two short, recognisable word examples** that show how English draws on different roots.
- Consider linking these examples more clearly to your main argument — that **“Britishness” is built on blending**, not purity.
