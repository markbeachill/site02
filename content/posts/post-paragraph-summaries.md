### What it does

The prompt goes through a piece of writing and provides once sentence summaries of each paragraph.

It then provides feedback on whether the points progress logically and clearly. 

This is useful for those wanting an overview of their work at a higher level so they can review whether the writing progresses effectively and so works as a whole.


### Instructions

Copy the prompt below and paste this into a chatbot such as ChatGPT, Claude or Grok etc. Submit the prompt.

The chatbot will ask you to submit your writing. Paste in the writing you want to analyse and submit it.

### Sample output


Here’s the paragraph-by-paragraph breakdown of your writing with one-sentence summaries:

1. **Britain’s identity is fluid and has been shaped by migration, adaptation, and cultural exchange over centuries.**  
2. **British culture, even in its most iconic forms, is a product of diverse influences and linguistic hybridity.**  
3. **The far right's notion of a fixed British culture ignores its evolving nature and the contributions of immigrants.**  
4. **Far right groups misuse symbols and nostalgia to promote a distorted, exclusionary version of British heritage.**  
5. **Anti-immigration rhetoric from the far right blames immigrants for economic struggles while ignoring systemic causes and the crucial role of migrant workers.**

---

#### Structural Analysis:

Looking at the summaries, yes — this **does hang together logically and progressively**, but here’s a brief review of the flow:

- **Paragraph 1 and 2** set a strong historical and cultural foundation: British identity is changeable and deeply influenced by others.
- **Paragraph 3** transitions smoothly to critique the far right’s resistance to this evolving identity.
- **Paragraph 4** continues by unpacking the misuse of national symbols, further undermining far-right claims.
- **Paragraph 5** extends the critique into economic arguments, showing how the far right misdirects blame for societal issues.

#### Minor Suggestions:
- **Paragraph 2** could arguably be merged with Paragraph 1, or explicitly linked with a connector phrase, since they both build the same foundational point about British identity and cultural fluidity.
- If space or clarity allows, consider a brief **concluding sentence or paragraph** that reaffirms your main thesis — that British culture is dynamic and inclusive, and far-right narratives are not only false but damaging.
