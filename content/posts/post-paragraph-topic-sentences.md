### What it does

The prompt goes through a piece of writing and provides possible alternative topic sentences. It then compares these topic sentences with your originals,

These suggestions allow you to see how powerful a tool topic sentences are for clarity and as a guide for writing.

It is ideal to help those wanting to improve how well their writing communicates with readers.


### Instructions

Copy the prompt below and paste this into a chatbot such as ChatGPT, Claude or Grok etc. Submit the prompt.

The chatbot will ask you to submit your writing. Paste in the writing you want to analyse and submit it.

### Sample output



### **Paragraph 1**

**Suggested topic sentence:**
> British identity has been shaped by centuries of migration, cultural exchange, and adaptation.

**Your original topic sentence:**
> Britain’s identity has been ever-changing, it has evolved through centuries of exchange, adaptation and migration.

**Why this change helps:**
Your sentence is quite close already, but it runs on and could be clearer. Breaking it into a single idea – *what shapes British identity* – gives the paragraph a stronger start. “Ever-changing” is vague, while “shaped by migration, exchange and adaptation” is more specific and leads clearly into your examples (Windrush, South Asian culture, European migrants).

### **Paragraph 2**

**Suggested topic sentence:**
> Many things seen as traditionally British, like fish and chips or the English language, have foreign origins that show how British culture is a blend of influences.

**Your original topic sentence:**
> Even quintessential British things like fish and chips were brought over by Jewish immigrants or even the language we speak today is a hybrid of Germanic, Latin and French roots, these all reflect the fluidity of the British nation.

**Why this change helps:**
Your original sentence includes lots of great points, but it tries to do too much at once and gets tangled. A strong topic sentence should *set up* the ideas, not list them all at once. The revised version separates the key point (foreign origins of British culture) and sets up the examples that follow.

### **Paragraph 3**

**Suggested topic sentence:**
> The far right’s idea of a fixed British culture ignores the long, diverse history that has shaped the nation.

**Your original topic sentence:**
> The far right’s insistence on protecting a static culture ignores history.

**Why this change helps:**
Your version is good but quite broad. By adding “long, diverse history” and “shaped the nation,” the sentence points clearly to the examples that follow. It helps the reader understand not just *what* the far right is doing wrong, but *why* it doesn’t make sense historically.
