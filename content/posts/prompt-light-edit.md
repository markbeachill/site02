### What it does

The prompt gets the AI chat to go through your writing and produce a light edit to improve the clarity of your writing.
It shows each paragraph with before and after side by side. After each paragraph it explains  the changes that have been made. It is ideal for those, such as students, who dont simply want edited text, but rather want to see how a light edit would work on their text. 

### Instructions

Copy the prompt below. Paste it into a Chatbot such as ChatGPT, Claude or Grok etc. Paste your writing below. Submit the combined prompt. Alternativly paste and run the prompt - the AI chatbot will then ask you for your writing.


### Sample output

**Paragraph Review**

| **Original Paragraph**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Edited Paragraph (Changes in Bold)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Her States touchdown consisted of crisis; the pandemic, a tense general election and Californian wild fires. “We lived for two weeks with toxic air,” she explains, “You couldn’t open the doors or windows. You just felt so dysphoric, like it was the end of days.” | Her **arrival in the US** consisted of crisis: the pandemic, a tense general election, and Californian **wildfires**. “We lived for two weeks with toxic air,” she explains. “You couldn’t open the doors or windows. You just felt so dysphoric, like it was the end of days.” |

**Changes Explained**

| **No.** | **Change**                                           | **Reason**                                                                                                                       |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | **"Her States touchdown" → "Her arrival in the US"** | “States touchdown” is an unusual and unclear phrase. “Arrival in the US” says the same thing more clearly and naturally.         |
| 2       | **Replaced semicolon with a colon**                  | A colon is more suitable here, as it introduces a list of crises. A semicolon would separate two full sentences.                 |
| 3       | **Added a comma after "election"**                   | To separate items in a list and follow standard punctuation rules.                                                               |
| 4       | **"wild fires" → "wildfires"**                       | “Wildfires” is one word in standard English usage.                                                                               |
| 5       | **Full stop after “she explains”**                   | Splitting the quote off into two sentences improves readability and separates her speech from the reporting clause more cleanly. |
