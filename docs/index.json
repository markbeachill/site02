[{"content":"What it does The prompt goes through a piece of writing and provides possible alternative topic sentences. It then compares these topic sentences with your originals,\nThese suggestions allow you to see how powerful a tool topic sentences are for clarity and as a guide for writing.\nIt is ideal to help those wanting to improve how well their writing communicates with readers.\nInstructions Copy the prompt below and paste this into a chatbot such as ChatGPT, Claude or Grok etc. Submit the prompt.\nThe chatbot will ask you to submit your writing. Paste in the writing you want to analyse and submit it.\nSample output Paragraph 1 Suggested topic sentence:\nBritish identity has been shaped by centuries of migration, cultural exchange, and adaptation.\nYour original topic sentence:\nBritain’s identity has been ever-changing, it has evolved through centuries of exchange, adaptation and migration.\nWhy this change helps: Your sentence is quite close already, but it runs on and could be clearer. Breaking it into a single idea – what shapes British identity – gives the paragraph a stronger start. “Ever-changing” is vague, while “shaped by migration, exchange and adaptation” is more specific and leads clearly into your examples (Windrush, South Asian culture, European migrants).\nParagraph 2 Suggested topic sentence:\nMany things seen as traditionally British, like fish and chips or the English language, have foreign origins that show how British culture is a blend of influences.\nYour original topic sentence:\nEven quintessential British things like fish and chips were brought over by Jewish immigrants or even the language we speak today is a hybrid of Germanic, Latin and French roots, these all reflect the fluidity of the British nation.\nWhy this change helps: Your original sentence includes lots of great points, but it tries to do too much at once and gets tangled. A strong topic sentence should set up the ideas, not list them all at once. The revised version separates the key point (foreign origins of British culture) and sets up the examples that follow.\nParagraph 3 Suggested topic sentence:\nThe far right’s idea of a fixed British culture ignores the long, diverse history that has shaped the nation.\nYour original topic sentence:\nThe far right’s insistence on protecting a static culture ignores history.\nWhy this change helps: Your version is good but quite broad. By adding “long, diverse history” and “shaped the nation,” the sentence points clearly to the examples that follow. It helps the reader understand not just what the far right is doing wrong, but why it doesn’t make sense historically.\nCopy prompt (UK English) (click copy on top right)\nContext: I am a student who needs help to improve my writing.

It is ideal for those who want to improve their writing and make sure they understand and cut out errors.\nFor a mistaek it produces: - Explanation of the mistake. - Examples of similar mistakes and their corrections. - Test questions and answers.- Discussion of this type of mistake, why it happens and what can be done to stop it.\nInstructions Option 1. Run using an error found in the \u0026ldquo;show errors\u0026rdquo; prompt.\nIn a chatbot such as ChatGPT, Claude or Grok etc. Run the \u0026ldquo;show errors\u0026rdquo; prompt on a piece of your writing. Look at the mistakes it identifies - they are numbered. Find one you want to fix. Make a note of the paragraph and the mistake number.\nContinue - in the same chat window. Copy the prompt below.\nEdit the end. Where the prompt says: \u0026ldquo;The mistake to focus on is MISTAKE NUMBER\u0026rdquo;, replace this your paragraph number and error number. For example, your edit might say; \u0026ldquo;The mistake to focus on is mistake 3 in paragaraph 1.\u0026rdquo; Run the prompt.\nOption 2. Use an example error you have found.**\nFind a sentence with an error and create a very brief description of that error. For example, \u0026ldquo;The trial took place at the central criminal court\u0026rdquo;. The description of the error would be: \u0026ldquo;incorrect capitalisation\u0026rdquo;.\nCopy the prompt below. In a chatbot such as ChatGPT, Claude or Grok etc. paste the prompt. Edit the end of the prompt. Where it says: \u0026ldquo;The mistake to focus on is MISTAKE NUMBER\u0026rdquo;, replace this with: \u0026ldquo;The mistake to focus on is \u0026ldquo;YOUR SENTENCE\u0026rdquo; (YOUR EXPLANATION).\nBased on the error this would be: \u0026ldquo;The mistake to focus on is \u0026ldquo;The trial took place at the central criminal court\u0026rdquo; (incorrect capitalisation)\u0026rdquo;. Run the prompt.\nAnd then? Go through the teaching material and test yourself. You may want to copy and save the teaching materials so you go through them again later.\nSample output For the prompt with this at the end: The mistake to focus on is \u0026ldquo;The trial took place at the central criminal court\u0026rdquo; (incorrect capitalisation).\nAbsolutely! Here\u0026rsquo;s the full teaching material on the incorrect capitalisation in the sentence \u0026ldquo;The trial took place at the central criminal court,\u0026rdquo; using plain text only and no symbols or emojis:\nTeaching Materials: Capitalisation of Proper Nouns A) Explanation of the Mistake The sentence \u0026ldquo;The trial took place at the central criminal court\u0026rdquo; contains a capitalisation error.\nThe phrase \u0026ldquo;central criminal court\u0026rdquo; refers to a specific, official institution—the Central Criminal Court—which is a proper noun. In English, proper nouns are the official names of particular people, places, organisations, or things, and they must begin with capital letters.\nBecause \u0026ldquo;Central Criminal Court\u0026rdquo; is the formal name of a specific court, each word in the name should be capitalised.\nCorrected sentence:\n\u0026ldquo;The trial took place at the Central Criminal Court.\u0026rdquo;\nIf the sentence were referring to courts in general (not naming a specific one), lowercase would be appropriate. But in this case, it is the name of a particular legal institution in London, so it needs capitalisation.\nB) Glossary of Terms Capitalisation\nThe use of capital (uppercase) letters. In English, we use capital letters for the first word in a sentence and for proper nouns.\nProper noun\nA noun that names a specific person, place, organisation, or thing. Proper nouns always begin with capital letters. Examples include \u0026ldquo;London\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Tesco\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Queen Elizabeth\u0026rdquo;.\nCommon noun\nA noun that refers to a general class of people, places, or things. These are not capitalised unless they start a sentence. Examples include \u0026ldquo;city\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;court\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;teacher\u0026rdquo;.\nC) Examples of Similar Mistakes and Corrections Incorrect: She studies law at the university of Oxford.\nCorrect: She studies law at the University of Oxford.\nIncorrect: They visited the tower of london on holiday.\nCorrect: They visited the Tower of London on holiday.\nIncorrect: The president met with the prime minister at downing street.\nCorrect: The President met with the Prime Minister at Downing Street.\nEach of these errors involves failing to capitalise proper nouns such as official place names or titles.\n### D) Test Questions Correct the capitalisation in the following sentences:\nthe ceremony was held at buckingham palace.\nhe took his driving test at the department for transport.\nthe report was submitted to the house of commons.\nthe statue is located in trafalgar square.\nshe got a job offer from the london school of economics.\nE) Answers for Test Questions The ceremony was held at Buckingham Palace.\nHe took his driving test at the Department for Transport.\nThe report was submitted to the House of Commons.\nThe statue is located in Trafalgar Square.\nShe got a job offer from the London School of Economics.\nF) Discussion of This Type of Error Based on Key Texts Writers like Lynne Truss (Eats, Shoots \u0026amp; Leaves) and resources such as The Oxford A–Z of Grammar and Punctuation highlight the importance of accurate capitalisation in formal writing. Capital letters help distinguish proper nouns (specific names) from common nouns (general references). When proper nouns are not capitalised, it can lead to confusion or make writing appear careless and informal.\nIn academic, professional, and legal contexts, accuracy in capitalisation contributes to clarity and respect for official institutions, people, and places.\nG) Reasons Why These Mistakes Are Made and What Can Be Done About Them Why do students make this mistake?\nSome names, like \u0026ldquo;central criminal court\u0026rdquo;, sound like descriptions, not official titles, which can make it unclear whether to capitalise them.\nIn speech, there’s no visible capitalisation, so students may not notice the difference in writing.\nTitles of institutions can be long and unfamiliar, making it harder to spot that they are proper nouns.\nWhat can be done to improve?\nAsk yourself: Is this the official name of a specific place or organisation? If so, capitalise it.\nDouble-check unfamiliar names: A quick search can confirm whether a phrase is a formal title.\nPractise editing: Go through writing with a focus only on capitalisation—this builds awareness and helps reinforce the rules.\nCopy prompt (UK English) (click copy on top right)\nContext: I am a student who needs help to improve my writing.

Paste in the writing you want to analyse and submit it.\nSample output Paragraph 1 Original:\nBritain’s identity has been ever-changing, it has evolved through centuries of exchange, adaptation and migration. The post World War 2 Windrush generation from the Caribbean, who brought vital labour to rebuild the nation, the influence of South Asian communities on cuisine and music and the integration of other European migrants, all demonstrate how British culture absorbs and transforms.\nFeedback:\nThe paragraph opens well, but the first sentence is a comma splice (two independent clauses joined incorrectly by a comma). This affects clarity. The topic sentence could be more sharply defined: what exactly are you arguing about British identity? The second sentence is long and could be broken for clarity. Consider foregrounding the argument rather than examples in the second sentence. Improved:\nBritain’s identity has never been fixed. It has evolved through centuries of exchange, adaptation and migration. The post-World War 2 Windrush generation from the Caribbean, who brought vital labour to rebuild the nation; the influence of South Asian communities on cuisine and music; and the integration of other European migrants all demonstrate how British culture absorbs and transforms.\nChanges Highlighted:\nChanged “has been ever-changing” to “has never been fixed” – clearer and more direct. Replaced comma with a full stop after \u0026ldquo;migration\u0026rdquo; to fix the comma splice. Separated listed groups with semicolons for readability. Removed commas around “all demonstrate…” to clarify the sentence structure. Paragraph 2 Original:\nEven quintessential British things like fish and chips were brought over by Jewish immigrants or even the language we speak today is a hybrid of Germanic, Latin and French roots, these all reflect the fluidity of the British nation.\nFeedback:\nAgain, a comma splice: this is one long sentence that needs breaking up. Two different ideas are squeezed into one sentence – the food and the language. Consider separating for flow and emphasis. The topic sentence should make clearer how these examples support your argument. Improved:\nEven quintessentially British things like fish and chips were brought over by Jewish immigrants. Even the language we speak today is a hybrid of Germanic, Latin and French roots. These all reflect the fluidity of the British nation.\nChanges Highlighted:\nReplaced “Even quintessential British things” with “Even quintessentially British things” (more idiomatic). Broke up the long sentence into two for clarity. Started the second idea with “Even the language we speak…” to add emphasis and rhythm. Overall Notes You have a clear voice and strong control of tone. Your content is compelling, but your paragraph structure sometimes gets in the way of clarity. To improve:\nAvoid comma splices. If in doubt, split sentences or use semicolons/dashes. Start each paragraph with a clear point — the topic sentence should guide everything that follows. Watch for overlong sentences and break them for clarity.

Paste it into a Chatbot such as ChatGPT, Claude or Grok etc. Paste your writing below. The AI chatbot will then ask you for your writing.\nSample output 1. Clarify and simplify the first sentence\nOriginal: Her States touchdown consisted of crisis; the pandemic, a tense general election and Californian wild fires.\nIssue: \u0026ldquo;States touchdown\u0026rdquo; is figurative but unclear. \u0026ldquo;Consisted of crisis\u0026rdquo; is overly abstract. There\u0026rsquo;s also a punctuation issue—the semicolon is not correctly used. Suggestion: Use plain, descriptive language and rephrase to make the crisis more immediate and readable. Suggested revision:\nWhen she arrived in the United States, she found herself in the middle of several crises: the pandemic, a tense general election, and wildfires across California.\n2. Check punctuation around quotes\nOriginal: “We lived for two weeks with toxic air,” she explains, “You couldn’t open the doors or windows\u0026hellip;\nIssue: This quote is fine as written, but the punctuation and structure surrounding it can be improved for flow. In UK English, commas and full stops typically go outside quotation marks unless part of the original quote. Suggested revision:\nKeep as is, but make sure to consistently follow British punctuation rules depending on your chosen style guide.\n3. Simplify the narration for tone and clarity\nOriginal: Covid restrictions aren’t dispiriting her family, though, says Lennox.\nIssue: “Dispiriting” is formal and slightly awkward here. The clause \u0026ldquo;though\u0026rdquo; in the middle disrupts the flow. Suggestion: Use plainer language and reorder for rhythm. Suggested revision:\nLennox says her family hasn’t been put off by the Covid restrictions.\n4. Tidy up the CDC reference\nOriginal: Her brother-in-law, who previously ran the CDC (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta), is “informed about epidemiology”\u0026hellip;\nIssue: The bracketed explanation is bulky and feels dropped in. It slows the pace and adds unnecessary formality. Trust your reader or integrate the info more smoothly. Suggestion: Rephrase with simpler structure. Suggested revision:\nHer brother-in-law, a former head of the CDC in Atlanta, is “informed about epidemiology”, so they rely on his advice.\n5. Reconsider phrasing in the health risk section\nOriginal: “you can’t take risks, for someone of 65-plus, you can’t afford to be exposed to it.”\nNote: As requested, the quote remains untouched. Issue (around the quote): No punctuation issue here, but make sure the lead-in is clean and not too formal. Suggested lead-in revision:\nShe adds:\n6. Simplify “Hence” and refine flow\nOriginal: Hence, Christmas will be a quiet occasion despite her approaching 66th birthday and the success of her rereleased album.\nIssue: “Hence” is formal and not in keeping with the tone of the rest. “Quiet occasion” is slightly stiff too. Suggestion: Use more natural connectors and phrasing. Suggested revision:\nSo Christmas will be a quiet one, even with her 66th birthday coming up and the success of her rereleased album.\n7. Clarify and tighten the final sentence\nOriginal: A remastered version of A Christmas Cornucopia will be released today, marking its 10-year anniversary.\nIssue: Slightly redundant phrasing—“will be released” and “marking” clash in tense/timing. Suggestion: Recast for clarity and consistency. Suggested revision:\nA remastered version of A Christmas Cornucopia is out today, marking its tenth anniversary.\nKey Style Takeaways\nAvoid formal connectors like “hence” in journalistic or mid-register writing—prefer simpler transitions like “so” or “as a result”. When introducing quotes, keep the sentence around them clean and rhythmical. Remove or rework any overly formal or academic phrasing (“consisted of crisis”, “dispiriting”, etc.). Trust the reader unless explanation is essential—excessive explanation of known institutions (e.g. CDC) can weigh the writing down. Use active, concrete verbs and avoid unnecessary abstract nouns.

You just felt so dysphoric, like it was the end of days.” Her arrival in the US consisted of crisis: the pandemic, a tense general election, and Californian wildfires. “We lived for two weeks with toxic air,” she explains. “You couldn’t open the doors or windows. You just felt so dysphoric, like it was the end of days.” Changes Explained\nNo. Change Reason 1 \u0026ldquo;Her States touchdown\u0026rdquo; → \u0026ldquo;Her arrival in the US\u0026rdquo; “States touchdown” is an unusual and unclear phrase. “Arrival in the US” says the same thing more clearly and naturally. 2 Replaced semicolon with a colon A colon is more suitable here, as it introduces a list of crises. A semicolon would separate two full sentences. 3 Added a comma after \u0026ldquo;election\u0026rdquo; To separate items in a list and follow standard punctuation rules. 4 \u0026ldquo;wild fires\u0026rdquo; → \u0026ldquo;wildfires\u0026rdquo; “Wildfires” is one word in standard English usage. 5 Full stop after “she explains” Splitting the quote off into two sentences improves readability and separates her speech from the reporting clause more cleanly.

British culture, even in its most iconic forms, is a product of diverse influences and linguistic hybridity. The far right\u0026rsquo;s notion of a fixed British culture ignores its evolving nature and the contributions of immigrants. Far right groups misuse symbols and nostalgia to promote a distorted, exclusionary version of British heritage. Anti-immigration rhetoric from the far right blames immigrants for economic struggles while ignoring systemic causes and the crucial role of migrant workers. Structural Analysis: Looking at the summaries, yes — this does hang together logically and progressively, but here’s a brief review of the flow:\nParagraph 1 and 2 set a strong historical and cultural foundation: British identity is changeable and deeply influenced by others. Paragraph 3 transitions smoothly to critique the far right’s resistance to this evolving identity. Paragraph 4 continues by unpacking the misuse of national symbols, further undermining far-right claims. Paragraph 5 extends the critique into economic arguments, showing how the far right misdirects blame for societal issues. Minor Suggestions: Paragraph 2 could arguably be merged with Paragraph 1, or explicitly linked with a connector phrase, since they both build the same foundational point about British identity and cultural fluidity. If space or clarity allows, consider a brief concluding sentence or paragraph that reaffirms your main thesis — that British culture is dynamic and inclusive, and far-right narratives are not only false but damaging.

The post World War 2 Windrush generation from the Caribbean, who brought vital labour to rebuild the nation, the influence of South Asian communities on cuisine and music and the integration of other European migrants, all demonstrate how British culture absorbs and transforms.\nSuggestions for expansion:\nYou could briefly name specific ways each group shaped Britain — for example, jobs the Windrush generation took on, or cultural traditions introduced by South Asian or European communities. Consider breaking this long sentence into two or three for clarity. This gives more space to build each point. You might also mention why this history matters today — for instance, how it challenges narrow views of what it means to be British. Think about making the timeline clearer. For example, “Over centuries, including key periods like post-WW2, Britain has…” This helps the reader follow the evolution. Paragraph 2: Even quintessential British things like fish and chips were brought over by Jewish immigrants or even the language we speak today is a hybrid of Germanic, Latin and French roots, these all reflect the fluidity of the British nation.\nSuggestions for expansion:\nYou could split this sentence. For example, one about fish and chips, one about language. That way, each point has room to be made clearly. Briefly mention which Jewish community introduced fish and chips (e.g. Sephardic Jews), to strengthen your historical point. For the language example, you could offer one or two short, recognisable word examples that show how English draws on different roots. Consider linking these examples more clearly to your main argument — that “Britishness” is built on blending, not purity.

Introduction Getting an AI to write something for you is cheating and will stop you learning. If you get AI to do your work for you then you will never improve, master the subject or improve your writing. It’s also very possible an assessor will spot AI written work as plagiarism immediately – it has its own patterns of vocabulary, grammar and structure that are unlike student work.\nIf you get an AI to act in a similar way to a human personal tutor then this can actually enhance your learning. You can do this by asking the right questions and using the results consciously and carefully. A good human tutor will guide you and help you but not do the work for you – can we get the AI to do the same?\nThis is a guide to help you try to use AI as a personal tutor that can help you check your work going forward. You can use it to get clearer and better writing.\nThe bulk of the information here is a set of prompts to get the AI acting as a personal tutor by giving you support on the paragraphs that you write.\nRemember, if you don’t get what you want or it stops halfway then tell the AI chatbot and it will try again.\nA BIG WARNING: The AI gets things wrong all the time. These are often quite subtle errors of meaning. Do not take what it writes as simply correct. Always apply your own judgement and scepticism. Indeed, if there is ANY reason to question its response then absolutely QUESTION ITS RESPONSE. This is even more important because when you question its response it will tend to give a better answer and it will explain more.\n\u0026lt;![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;![endif]\u0026gt;\n2. Some principles to apply never ask it to write something for you (like you would never ask your university tutor).\nalways start with your own writing.\nalways expect it can make things up like quotes!\nread your original and the new version as if you have personal tutor.\nAnd then type in your new version using the insights from the feedback.\nOnly ever use things you understand – look things up when you don’t (or ask the AI to explain!)\nRemember you are 100% responsible for what you submit.\nIf you are unsure contact your tutor.\nSave a record of what you did and the results for further study.\n3. AI websites Don’t just stick to one AI engine – you should try several and evaluate how each works for you.\nThey will also change over time so periodically retry new ones for the best results. And the free versions may be different from the paid versions.\nThis should generally not cost you money. If you run out of free prompts on one site then you may have to wait – or simply try another chatbot.\nAll these are worth trying with Claude, ChatGPT and Grok doing quite well.\nThese are a selection of AI chatbot websites:\nClaude\nhttps://claude.ai/chat/\nChatGPT\nhttps://chat.openai.com/\nGemini\nhttps://gemini.google.com/app\nGrok\nhttps://x.com/i/grok\nCo-Pilot (choose “exact” option)\nhttps://copilot.microsoft.com/\nPerplexity\nhttps://www.perplexity.ai/\nMeta AI (USA only at moment)\nhttps://www.meta.ai/\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/site02/introduction/","summary":"Using AI as a personal writing tutor","title":"Using AI as a personal writing tutor"},{"content":"What it does The prompt goes through a piece of writing and attempts to reduce the wordcount by 10%.\nIt explains all the changes made.\nIt is ideal to help those wanting to tighten up their writing.\nInstructions Copy the prompt below and paste this into a chatbot such as ChatGPT, Claude or Grok etc. Submit the prompt.\nThe chatbot will ask you to submit your writing.

Let’s revise this paragraph by reducing the word count by about 10%, keeping direct quotes intact (though there are none here).

Both mean ongoing change. it has evolved through centuries of evolving through centuries of Combined two sentences into one to remove repetition of “it has” and keep it flowing better. post World War 2 post-World War II Added hyphen for correct form and used Roman numerals to match formal style—same meaning, fewer characters. from the Caribbean, who brought vital labour to rebuild the nation (removed) This detail, while rich, was trimmed to hit the word count goal. It’s implied by “Windrush generation” in this context. the influence of South Asian communities on cuisine and music South Asian influence on food and music Replaced “the influence of\u0026hellip; on” with “influence on” and used “food” instead of “cuisine” for plain, everyday English. and the integration of other European migrants and the arrival of other European migrants “Arrival” is more concise and carries the same meaning in this context. “Integration” can be implied by the phrase “absorbs and transforms” at the end. all demonstrate how British culture absorbs and transforms all show how British culture absorbs and transforms “Show” is simpler than “demonstrate” and cuts a word.
