The Plain English Campaign UK. B. \u0026ldquo;Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace\u0026rdquo; by Joseph M. Williams. C. George Orwell’s “Politics and the English Language”. It also aims for a register between journalistic and academic. In other words, it wants straightforward but still fairly formal writing.\nInstructions Copy the prompt below. Paste it into a Chatbot such as ChatGPT, Claude or Grok etc. Paste your writing below. The AI chatbot will then ask you for your writing.\nSample output 1. Clarify and simplify the first sentence\nOriginal: Her States touchdown consisted of crisis; the pandemic, a tense general election and Californian wild fires.\nIssue: \u0026ldquo;States touchdown\u0026rdquo; is figurative but unclear. \u0026ldquo;Consisted of crisis\u0026rdquo; is overly abstract. There\u0026rsquo;s also a punctuation issue—the semicolon is not correctly used. Suggestion: Use plain, descriptive language and rephrase to make the crisis more immediate and readable. Suggested revision:\nWhen she arrived in the United States, she found herself in the middle of several crises: the pandemic, a tense general election, and wildfires across California.\n2. Check punctuation around quotes\nOriginal: “We lived for two weeks with toxic air,” she explains, “You couldn’t open the doors or windows\u0026hellip;\nIssue: This quote is fine as written, but the punctuation and structure surrounding it can be improved for flow. In UK English, commas and full stops typically go outside quotation marks unless part of the original quote. Suggested revision:\nKeep as is, but make sure to consistently follow British punctuation rules depending on your chosen style guide.\n3. Simplify the narration for tone and clarity\nOriginal: Covid restrictions aren’t dispiriting her family, though, says Lennox.\nIssue: “Dispiriting” is formal and slightly awkward here. The clause \u0026ldquo;though\u0026rdquo; in the middle disrupts the flow. Suggestion: Use plainer language and reorder for rhythm. Suggested revision:\nLennox says her family hasn’t been put off by the Covid restrictions.\n4. Tidy up the CDC reference\nOriginal: Her brother-in-law, who previously ran the CDC (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta), is “informed about epidemiology”\u0026hellip;\nIssue: The bracketed explanation is bulky and feels dropped in. It slows the pace and adds unnecessary formality. Trust your reader or integrate the info more smoothly. Suggestion: Rephrase with simpler structure. Suggested revision:\nHer brother-in-law, a former head of the CDC in Atlanta, is “informed about epidemiology”, so they rely on his advice.\n5. Reconsider phrasing in the health risk section\nOriginal: “you can’t take risks, for someone of 65-plus, you can’t afford to be exposed to it.”\nNote: As requested, the quote remains untouched. Issue (around the quote): No punctuation issue here, but make sure the lead-in is clean and not too formal. Suggested lead-in revision:\nShe adds:\n6. Simplify “Hence” and refine flow\nOriginal: Hence, Christmas will be a quiet occasion despite her approaching 66th birthday and the success of her rereleased album.\nIssue: “Hence” is formal and not in keeping with the tone of the rest. “Quiet occasion” is slightly stiff too. Suggestion: Use more natural connectors and phrasing. Suggested revision:\nSo Christmas will be a quiet one, even with her 66th birthday coming up and the success of her rereleased album.\n7. Clarify and tighten the final sentence\nOriginal: A remastered version of A Christmas Cornucopia will be released today, marking its 10-year anniversary.\nIssue: Slightly redundant phrasing—“will be released” and “marking” clash in tense/timing. Suggestion: Recast for clarity and consistency. Suggested revision:\nA remastered version of A Christmas Cornucopia is out today, marking its tenth anniversary.\nKey Style Takeaways\nAvoid formal connectors like “hence” in journalistic or mid-register writing—prefer simpler transitions like “so” or “as a result”. When introducing quotes, keep the sentence around them clean and rhythmical. Remove or rework any overly formal or academic phrasing (“consisted of crisis”, “dispiriting”, etc.). Trust the reader unless explanation is essential—excessive explanation of known institutions (e.g. CDC) can weigh the writing down. Use active, concrete verbs and avoid unnecessary abstract nouns.

You just felt so dysphoric, like it was the end of days.” Her arrival in the US consisted of crisis: the pandemic, a tense general election, and Californian wildfires. “We lived for two weeks with toxic air,” she explains. “You couldn’t open the doors or windows. You just felt so dysphoric, like it was the end of days.” Changes Explained\nNo. Change Reason 1 \u0026ldquo;Her States touchdown\u0026rdquo; → \u0026ldquo;Her arrival in the US\u0026rdquo; “States touchdown” is an unusual and unclear phrase. “Arrival in the US” says the same thing more clearly and naturally. 2 Replaced semicolon with a colon A colon is more suitable here, as it introduces a list of crises. A semicolon would separate two full sentences. 3 Added a comma after \u0026ldquo;election\u0026rdquo; To separate items in a list and follow standard punctuation rules. 4 \u0026ldquo;wild fires\u0026rdquo; → \u0026ldquo;wildfires\u0026rdquo; “Wildfires” is one word in standard English usage. 5 Full stop after “she explains” Splitting the quote off into two sentences improves readability and separates her speech from the reporting clause more cleanly.
