Paste it into a Chatbot such as ChatGPT, Claude or Grok etc. Paste your writing below. Submit the combined prompt. Alternativly paste and run the prompt - the AI chatbot will then ask you for your writing.\nSample output Paragraph Review\nOriginal Paragraph Edited Paragraph (Changes in Bold) Her States touchdown consisted of crisis; the pandemic, a tense general election and Californian wild fires. “We lived for two weeks with toxic air,” she explains, “You couldn’t open the doors or windows. You just felt so dysphoric, like it was the end of days.” Her arrival in the US consisted of crisis: the pandemic, a tense general election, and Californian wildfires. “We lived for two weeks with toxic air,” she explains. “You couldn’t open the doors or windows. You just felt so dysphoric, like it was the end of days.” Changes Explained\nNo. Change Reason 1 \u0026ldquo;Her States touchdown\u0026rdquo; → \u0026ldquo;Her arrival in the US\u0026rdquo; “States touchdown” is an unusual and unclear phrase. “Arrival in the US” says the same thing more clearly and naturally. 2 Replaced semicolon with a colon A colon is more suitable here, as it introduces a list of crises. A semicolon would separate two full sentences. 3 Added a comma after \u0026ldquo;election\u0026rdquo; To separate items in a list and follow standard punctuation rules. 4 \u0026ldquo;wild fires\u0026rdquo; → \u0026ldquo;wildfires\u0026rdquo; “Wildfires” is one word in standard English usage. 5 Full stop after “she explains” Splitting the quote off into two sentences improves readability and separates her speech from the reporting clause more cleanly.
