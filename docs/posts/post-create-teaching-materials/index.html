  "articleBody": "What it does The prompt creates personalised teaching materials based on fixing a mistake. It is ideal for those who want to improve their writing and make sure they understand and cut out errors.\nFor a mistaek it produces: - Explanation of the mistake. - Examples of similar mistakes and their corrections. - Test questions and answers.- Discussion of this type of mistake, why it happens and what can be done to stop it.\nInstructions Option 1. Run using an error found in the “show errors” prompt.\nIn a chatbot such as ChatGPT, Claude or Grok etc. Run the “show errors” prompt on a piece of your writing. Look at the mistakes it identifies - they are numbered. Find one you want to fix. Make a note of the paragraph and the mistake number.\nContinue - in the same chat window. Copy the prompt below.\nEdit the end. Where the prompt says: “The mistake to focus on is MISTAKE NUMBER”, replace this your paragraph number and error number. For example, your edit might say; “The mistake to focus on is mistake 3 in paragaraph 1.” Run the prompt.\nOption 2. Use an example error you have found.**\nFind a sentence with an error and create a very brief description of that error. For example, “The trial took place at the central criminal court”. The description of the error would be: “incorrect capitalisation”.\nCopy the prompt below. In a chatbot such as ChatGPT, Claude or Grok etc. paste the prompt. Edit the end of the prompt. Where it says: “The mistake to focus on is MISTAKE NUMBER”, replace this with: “The mistake to focus on is “YOUR SENTENCE” (YOUR EXPLANATION).\nBased on the error this would be: “The mistake to focus on is “The trial took place at the central criminal court” (incorrect capitalisation)”. Run the prompt.\nAnd then? Go through the teaching material and test yourself. You may want to copy and save the teaching materials so you go through them again later.\nSample output For the prompt with this at the end: The mistake to focus on is “The trial took place at the central criminal court” (incorrect capitalisation).\nAbsolutely! Here’s the full teaching material on the incorrect capitalisation in the sentence “The trial took place at the central criminal court,” using plain text only and no symbols or emojis:\nTeaching Materials: Capitalisation of Proper Nouns A) Explanation of the Mistake The sentence “The trial took place at the central criminal court” contains a capitalisation error.\nThe phrase “central criminal court” refers to a specific, official institution—the Central Criminal Court—which is a proper noun. In English, proper nouns are the official names of particular people, places, organisations, or things, and they must begin with capital letters.\nBecause “Central Criminal Court” is the formal name of a specific court, each word in the name should be capitalised.\nCorrected sentence:\n“The trial took place at the Central Criminal Court.”\nIf the sentence were referring to courts in general (not naming a specific one), lowercase would be appropriate. But in this case, it is the name of a particular legal institution in London, so it needs capitalisation.\nB) Glossary of Terms Capitalisation\nThe use of capital (uppercase) letters. In English, we use capital letters for the first word in a sentence and for proper nouns.\nProper noun\nA noun that names a specific person, place, organisation, or thing. Proper nouns always begin with capital letters. Examples include “London”, “Tesco”, and “Queen Elizabeth”.\nCommon noun\nA noun that refers to a general class of people, places, or things. These are not capitalised unless they start a sentence. Examples include “city”, “court”, and “teacher”.\nC) Examples of Similar Mistakes and Corrections Incorrect: She studies law at the university of Oxford.\nCorrect: She studies law at the University of Oxford.\nIncorrect: They visited the tower of london on holiday.\nCorrect: They visited the Tower of London on holiday.\nIncorrect: The president met with the prime minister at downing street.\nCorrect: The President met with the Prime Minister at Downing Street.\nEach of these errors involves failing to capitalise proper nouns such as official place names or titles.\n### D) Test Questions Correct the capitalisation in the following sentences:\nthe ceremony was held at buckingham palace.\nhe took his driving test at the department for transport.\nthe report was submitted to the house of commons.\nthe statue is located in trafalgar square.\nshe got a job offer from the london school of economics.\nE) Answers for Test Questions The ceremony was held at Buckingham Palace.\nHe took his driving test at the Department for Transport.\nThe report was submitted to the House of Commons.\nThe statue is located in Trafalgar Square.\nShe got a job offer from the London School of Economics.\nF) Discussion of This Type of Error Based on Key Texts Writers like Lynne Truss (Eats, Shoots \u0026 Leaves) and resources such as The Oxford A–Z of Grammar and Punctuation highlight the importance of accurate capitalisation in formal writing. Capital letters help distinguish proper nouns (specific names) from common nouns (general references). When proper nouns are not capitalised, it can lead to confusion or make writing appear careless and informal.\nIn academic, professional, and legal contexts, accuracy in capitalisation contributes to clarity and respect for official institutions, people, and places.\nG) Reasons Why These Mistakes Are Made and What Can Be Done About Them Why do students make this mistake?\nSome names, like “central criminal court”, sound like descriptions, not official titles, which can make it unclear whether to capitalise them.\nIn speech, there’s no visible capitalisation, so students may not notice the difference in writing.\nTitles of institutions can be long and unfamiliar, making it harder to spot that they are proper nouns.\nWhat can be done to improve?\nAsk yourself: Is this the official name of a specific place or organisation? If so, capitalise it.\nDouble-check unfamiliar names: A quick search can confirm whether a phrase is a formal title.\nPractise editing: Go through writing with a focus only on capitalisation—this builds awareness and helps reinforce the rules.\nCopy prompt (UK English) (click copy on top right)\nContext: I am a student who needs help to improve my writing.

<p>The prompt creates personalised teaching materials based on fixing a mistake. It is ideal for those who want to improve their writing and make sure they understand and cut out errors.</p>
<p>For a mistaek it produces: - Explanation of the mistake. - Examples of similar mistakes and their corrections. - Test questions and answers.-  Discussion of this type of mistake, why it happens and what can be done to stop it.</p>
<h3 id="instructions">Instructions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#instructions">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Option 1. Run using an error found in the &ldquo;show errors&rdquo; prompt.</strong></p>
<p>In a chatbot such as ChatGPT, Claude or Grok etc.  Run the <a href="https://markbeachill.github.io/site02/posts/prompt-show-errors/">&ldquo;show errors&rdquo; prompt</a> on a piece of your writing. Look at the mistakes it identifies - they are numbered. Find one you want to fix. Make a note of the paragraph and the mistake number.</p>
<p>Continue - in the same chat window. Copy the prompt below.</p>
<p>Edit the end. Where the prompt says: &ldquo;The mistake to focus on is MISTAKE NUMBER&rdquo;, replace this your paragraph number and error number. For example, your edit might say; &ldquo;The mistake to focus on is <strong>mistake 3 in paragaraph 1.</strong>&rdquo; Run the prompt.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2. Use an example error you have found.</strong>**</p>
<p>Find a sentence with an  error and create a very brief description of that error.
For example, &ldquo;The trial took place at the central criminal court&rdquo;. The description of the error would be: &ldquo;incorrect capitalisation&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Copy the prompt below. In a chatbot such as ChatGPT, Claude or Grok etc.  paste the prompt.
Edit the end of the prompt.  Where it says: &ldquo;The mistake to focus on is MISTAKE NUMBER&rdquo;, replace this with: &ldquo;The mistake to focus on is &ldquo;YOUR SENTENCE&rdquo; (YOUR EXPLANATION).</p>
<p>Based on the error this would be: &ldquo;<strong>The mistake to focus on is &ldquo;The trial took place at the central criminal court&rdquo; (incorrect capitalisation)&rdquo;</strong>. Run the prompt.</p>
<p><strong>And then?</strong>
Go through the teaching material and test yourself. You may want to copy and save the teaching materials so you go through them again later.</p>

<p>For the prompt with this at the end:
<em>The mistake to focus on is &ldquo;The trial took place at the central criminal court&rdquo; (incorrect capitalisation).</em></p>
<p>Absolutely! Here&rsquo;s the full teaching material on the <strong>incorrect capitalisation</strong> in the sentence <em>&ldquo;The trial took place at the central criminal court,&rdquo;</em> using plain text only and no symbols or emojis:</p>

<h3 id="a-explanation-of-the-mistake"><span style="color:blue;">A) Explanation of the Mistake</span><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-explanation-of-the-mistake">#</a></h3>
<p>The sentence <strong>&ldquo;The trial took place at the central criminal court&rdquo;</strong> contains a capitalisation error.</p>
<p>The phrase <strong>&ldquo;central criminal court&rdquo;</strong> refers to a specific, official institution—the <strong>Central Criminal Court</strong>—which is a proper noun. In English, <strong>proper nouns</strong> are the official names of particular people, places, organisations, or things, and they must begin with capital letters.</p>
<p>Because &ldquo;Central Criminal Court&rdquo; is the formal name of a specific court, each word in the name should be capitalised.</p>
<p><strong>Corrected sentence</strong>:<br>
<strong>&ldquo;The trial took place at the Central Criminal Court.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>If the sentence were referring to courts in general (not naming a specific one), lowercase would be appropriate. But in this case, it is the name of a particular legal institution in London, so it needs capitalisation.</p>

<p><strong>Capitalisation</strong><br>
The use of capital (uppercase) letters. In English, we use capital letters for the first word in a sentence and for proper nouns.</p>
<p><strong>Proper noun</strong><br>
A noun that names a specific person, place, organisation, or thing. Proper nouns always begin with capital letters. Examples include &ldquo;London&rdquo;, &ldquo;Tesco&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Queen Elizabeth&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Common noun</strong><br>
A noun that refers to a general class of people, places, or things. These are not capitalised unless they start a sentence. Examples include &ldquo;city&rdquo;, &ldquo;court&rdquo;, and &ldquo;teacher&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Writers like Lynne Truss (<em>Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves</em>) and resources such as <em>The Oxford A–Z of Grammar and Punctuation</em> highlight the importance of accurate capitalisation in formal writing. Capital letters help distinguish <strong>proper nouns</strong> (specific names) from <strong>common nouns</strong> (general references). When proper nouns are not capitalised, it can lead to confusion or make writing appear careless and informal.</p>
<p>In academic, professional, and legal contexts, accuracy in capitalisation contributes to clarity and respect for official institutions, people, and places.</p>

<p><strong>Why do students make this mistake?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some names, like &ldquo;central criminal court&rdquo;, <strong>sound like descriptions</strong>, not official titles, which can make it unclear whether to capitalise them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <strong>speech</strong>, there’s no visible capitalisation, so students may not notice the difference in writing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Titles of institutions</strong> can be long and unfamiliar, making it harder to spot that they are proper nouns.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What can be done to improve?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask yourself</strong>: Is this the official name of a specific place or organisation? If so, capitalise it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Double-check unfamiliar names</strong>: A quick search can confirm whether a phrase is a formal title.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practise editing</strong>: Go through writing with a focus only on capitalisation—this builds awareness and helps reinforce the rules.</p>
</li>
</ul>
